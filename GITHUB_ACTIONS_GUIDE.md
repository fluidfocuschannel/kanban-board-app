# Building Your Kanban Board Project with GitHub Actions

## Overview

Your project already has a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline configured in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. This guide explains how it works and how to set it up properly.

## Current Workflow Structure

The GitHub Actions workflow includes the following jobs:

### 1. Backend Test & Build (`backend-test-build`)
- **Triggers**: Push to `main` or `develop` branches, PRs to `main`
- **What it does**:
  - Sets up Node.js 18
  - Starts MongoDB service for testing
  - Installs backend dependencies
  - Runs backend tests
  - Builds the backend TypeScript code
  - Uploads build artifacts

### 2. Frontend Test & Build (`frontend-test-build`)
- **Triggers**: Same as backend
- **What it does**:
  - Sets up Node.js 18
  - Installs frontend dependencies
  - Runs ESLint for code quality
  - Runs frontend tests
  - Builds the React/Vite application
  - Uploads build artifacts

### 3. Security Scan (`security-scan`)
- **Triggers**: After both build jobs complete
- **What it does**:
  - Runs Trivy vulnerability scanner
  - Uploads security results to GitHub Security tab

### 4. Deploy to Staging (`deploy-staging`)
- **Triggers**: Only on `develop` branch
- **What it does**:
  - Downloads build artifacts
  - Deploys to staging environment (needs configuration)

### 5. Deploy to Production (`deploy-production`)
- **Triggers**: Only on `main` branch
- **What it does**:
  - Downloads build artifacts
  - Deploys to production environment (needs configuration)

### 6. Docker Build & Push (`docker-build-push`)
- **Triggers**: Only on `main` branch
- **What it does**:
  - Builds Docker images for both frontend and backend
  - Pushes images to Docker Hub

## Required GitHub Secrets

To make the workflow fully functional, you need to set up these secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Repository Settings â†’ Secrets and Variables â†’ Actions

1. **MONGODB_URI**: MongoDB connection string for production
2. **JWT_SECRET**: Secret key for JWT token signing
3. **VITE_API_URL**: API URL for the frontend (optional, defaults to localhost)
4. **DOCKER_USERNAME**: Your Docker Hub username
5. **DOCKER_PASSWORD**: Your Docker Hub password or access token

## How to Set Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Navigate to **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Add each secret with its corresponding value

## Local Development Scripts

The root `package.json` now includes convenient scripts:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Build everything
npm run build:all

# Build individual parts
npm run build:client
npm run build:server

# Run tests
npm run test:all
npm run test:client
npm run test:server

# Development
npm run dev:client    # Start Vite dev server
npm run dev:server    # Start backend with hot reload

# Linting
npm run lint:client

# Production
npm run start:server  # Start production server
```

## How the Build Process Works

### Backend Build Process
1. **Dependencies**: `npm ci` installs exact versions from package-lock.json
2. **TypeScript Compilation**: `tsc` compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in `dist/` folder
3. **Artifacts**: Built files are uploaded for deployment jobs

### Frontend Build Process
1. **Dependencies**: `npm ci` installs exact versions
2. **Type Checking**: `tsc -b` checks TypeScript types
3. **Vite Build**: Creates optimized production bundle in `dist/` folder
4. **Artifacts**: Built files are uploaded for deployment jobs

### Docker Build Process
1. **Backend**: Creates Node.js container with compiled TypeScript
2. **Frontend**: Multi-stage build with Nginx serving static files

## Triggering Builds

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to `main`**: Runs full pipeline including production deployment
- **Push to `develop`**: Runs full pipeline including staging deployment
- **Pull Request to `main`**: Runs tests and builds (no deployment)

### Manual Triggers
You can also trigger workflows manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Monitoring Builds

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. View running/completed workflows
4. Click on any workflow run to see detailed logs

## Environment Configuration

### Staging Environment
- Triggered on `develop` branch
- Uses staging secrets and configuration
- Safe environment for testing

### Production Environment
- Triggered on `main` branch
- Uses production secrets and configuration
- Live environment for users

## Deployment Customization

The current deployment steps are placeholders. To customize:

1. **For cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP):
   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy to AWS
     run: |
       aws s3 sync client/dist/ s3://your-bucket-name
       aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_ID --paths "/*"
   ```

2. **For traditional servers**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy via SSH
     run: |
       rsync -avz --delete client/dist/ user@server:/var/www/html/
       ssh user@server 'sudo systemctl restart nginx'
   ```

3. **For container platforms**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
     run: |
       kubectl set image deployment/frontend frontend=${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/kanban-frontend:${{ github.sha }}
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Check if all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
   - Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds locally
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

2. **Test Failures**:
   - Currently using placeholder tests
   - Add proper test suites using Jest, Vitest, or similar

3. **Docker Build Issues**:
   - Ensure Dockerfiles are in correct locations
   - Check if Docker Hub credentials are correct
   - Verify image names don't conflict

4. **Deployment Issues**:
   - Ensure all required secrets are set
   - Check if deployment targets are accessible
   - Verify permissions for deployment operations

## Next Steps

1. **Add Real Tests**: Replace placeholder tests with actual test suites
2. **Configure Deployment**: Set up actual deployment targets
3. **Add Monitoring**: Include health checks and monitoring
4. **Security**: Add additional security scans and checks
5. **Notifications**: Set up Slack/email notifications for build status

## Example Workflow Run

When you push to `main`:
1. âœ… Backend builds and tests pass
2. âœ… Frontend builds and lints successfully
3. âœ… Security scan completes
4. âœ… Docker images are built and pushed
5. âœ… Production deployment executes
6. ðŸŽ‰ Your application is live!

This setup provides a robust, production-ready CI/CD pipeline for your Kanban board application.
